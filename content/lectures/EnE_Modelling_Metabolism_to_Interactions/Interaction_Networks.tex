  \begin{frame}{Summary}
  
    \begin{itemize}[<+->] \setlength{\itemindent}{0em} \itemsep10pt

        \item Darwin's {\it Gedankenexperiment} --- every ecosystem is more than the sum of its parts (species's populations) because of underlying interaction networks
        
        \item Network motifs (small sub-networks) are the building blocks of Ecological networks
        \begin{itemize}
          \item They can be selected/favoured by stability
        \end{itemize} 
    
        \item Trophic networks are arguably the most important type of ecological network
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Important for understanding the many effects of of global change
        \end{itemize}

        \item Metabolism is key for understanding trophic networks and the emergent ecosystem dynamics
        
    \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Discussion Questions}

  \begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemindent}{-2em}\itemsep4pt
  
    \item What sorts of interactions might ancient microbes have had? What type(s) of Ecological Network(s)? 

    \item What are the differences and similarities between microbial networks (who-eats-what type) and food webs (who-eats-whom type)? 

    \item What did you learn about types of building blocks of food webs from the EcoBuilder game? What types of trophic interaction modules?
    
    \item What role do indirect interactions play in trophic network / food web dynamics?

    \item How are trophic/biomass/ecological pyramids related to body size structure in food webs?

    \item How do you think climatic temperature (and warming) affects trophic networks / food webs?
