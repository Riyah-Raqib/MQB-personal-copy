  abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, And ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology},

  abstract = "Evaluating the strength of interactions among species is an
              important step in understanding the structure of natural
              communities and predicting how they will respond to changes in the
              biotic environment. Where feasible, accurate characterization of
              interaction strength can shift the theory of multispecies
              communities from identifying the vast range of possibilities to
              isolating the most likely possibilities. To derive generality in
              our understanding of interaction strengths, however. they must be
              placed within a unified framework, a framework that can be applied
              to empirical situations. In this paper we first identify four
              different theoretical concepts of in eraction strength prevalent
              in the literature (community matrix, Jacobian matrix, inverse
              Jacobian, and removal matrix), showing how they are related to
              each other and how they are derived. We also demonstrate that
              their behavior is not necessarily concordant; hence it is
              important to identify clearly which concept of interaction
              strength is being discussed. Then we evaluate several
              observational and experimental approaches to estimating
              interaction strength empirically, highlighting their ties to
              theory, if any, and the limitations and strengths of each
              approach. Finally, we apply several techniques to a simulated data
              set, based on an intertidal community, evaluating both accuracy
              and logistical ease of these approaches. We find that per capita
              interaction strength is often the most useful index to measure,
              that caution must be exercised in interpreting empirical estimates
              of interaction strength because of equilibrium assumptions and the
              potential confounding effect of indirect effects, and that
              concentrating on evaluating the relationship between empirically
              observed rates of change and species abundances may be a
              profitable way to proceed",

              the character. Both within- and between-species competition are
              considered and a general model of the genetic basis of the
              character is us d. The genetic and ecological parts of the model
              are based on the biological assumptions that are made in
              discussions of ecological character displacement, which include
              the assumptions that there are no constraints on the evolution of
              the character in either species and that individuals in each
              species with the same value of the character use the limiting
              resources in the same way. The usual biological assumptions do not
              necessarily lead to permanent and significant displacement. In the
              present model, 2 types of conditions lead to significant character
              displacement under biologically reasonable assumptions. One type
              of condition, which would apply to species that are roughly
              equally abundant at equilibrium, is that there be some differences
              in the set of limiting resources of the 2 spp. In that case, the
              equilibrium displacement would be much larger than the differences
              between the resource spectra. Small and possibly unmeasurable
              differences between species could lead to significant
              displacements. The other type of resource distribution that leads
              to significant displacements is a skewed distribution. This
              requires no differences between the resource spectra for the 2
              spp. but it leads to an equilibrium in which one of the species is
              much more abundant than the other. One consequence of these
              results is that the relative abundances of 2 spp. thought to have
              undergone character displacement are important to understanding
              the possible mechanisms leading to that displacement.",

              was not a distinguished student of ecology and who was outspokenly

              venture to establish plankton studies on a quantitative basis.
              This paradox of the position of Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) in the
              history of ecology poses the problem for this paper. Haeckel's
              major contributions may be best understood as an immediate
              byproduct of his aim to interpret Darwin's thought for the
              scientiiic world of Germany rather than as the logical outgrowth
              of his own research. In his work as a field naturalist, Haeckel
              showed a painter's eye for the beauties of nature, and he was an
              ardent collector whose travels ranged from Norway, Helgoland, the
              Canaries, and Messina to the Red Sea, Cylon, and Java. This wide
              and vivid experience brought him some ap- preciation of ecological
              points of view, but Haeckel did not display any notable insight
              into the dynamic principles of ecology. My purpose here is to
              examine the nature and the personal limitations of Haeckel's
              contributions to the science he named and to demonstrate its

              models for life-history evolution. It helped to galvanize the
              empirical field of comparative life-history and dominated thinking
              on the subject from the late 1960 through the 1970s. Large
              quantities of field data were collected that claimed to test
              predictions of the theory. By the early 1980s, sentiment about the
              theory had changed so completely that a proposal to test it or the
              use of it to interpret empirical results would likely be viewed as
              archaic and naive. The theory was displaced,by demographic models
              that concentrated on mortality patterns as the cause of
              life-history evolution. Although demographic models are known for
              their density-independent approach and focus on extrinsic
              mortality, these models can incorporate many ecological features
              captured by r- and K-selection, such as density-dependent
              population regulation, resource availability, and environmental
              fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these factors in
              recent theory, then show how they are manifest in our research on
              life-history evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia
              reticulata). Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history
              differences across populations of guppies originate from
              demographic models of predator-driven age-specific mortality.
              Recently, careful examination of guppy demography and habitat has
              revealed that density-dependent regulation and resource
              availability may have influenced the evolution of guppy life
              histories. In the field, these factors covary with predation risk;
              however, they can be uncoupled experimentally, providing insight
              into how they may have synergistically driven guppy life-history
              evolution. Although life-history theory has shifted away from a
              focus on r- and K-selection, the themes of density-dependent
              regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations
              are integral to current demographic theory and are potentially
              important in any natural system",

              greatly increased growth within fewer than 300 generations, at the
              expense of reduced growth in the Light. Lines maintained in both

              dynamics. This suggests that it should be a common feature of

              where it has been demonstrated. We suggest in this paper that the
              reason for this contrast may lie in the reproductive system.
              Whereas ecological modelling traditionally deals with asexual
              organisms, we introduce sexual reproduction (and thus explicit
              population genetics) into the population dynamic models. As
              specific examples, we describe the effect of sexual reproduction
              on two models (a host-parasite model and a predator-prey model)
              which exhibit chaotic behaviour for many sets of parameters. The
              results show that sexual reproduction generally reduces the
              complexity of the system, leading to a stable equilibrium or other
              forms of simple dynamics, or at least reducing the fluctuations of
              the system. Thus the chaotic behaviour predicted by many
              population dynamic models may be restricted to systems with
              asexual reproduction",

               single species and for the structure of biological communities.
               The rapidly growing evidence for the importance of interspecific
               competition include the relationship between species numbers and
               environmental complexity, resource sharing among coexisting
               species, and character displacement, viz., that where the

               with respect to morphological, physiological, or behavioral
               characters (assumed or demonstrated to be related to resource
               exploitation) than where the same species occur allopatrically

               contributions (MacArthur and Levins, 1967; MacArthur and Wilson,
               1967; Roughgarden, 1972) have considered the evolution of
               competing species. These models do not, however, consider
               outbreeding, Plendelian populations. The purpose of the present
               paper is t o develop some general models which describe the
               evolution of competing species and thus of character divergence
               and niche width in Mendelian populations, and which include
               intraspecific competition and a restricted resource spectrum.

              characteristics; 2) a plant competition experiment; and 3)
              abundance of Orbatid mites along environmental gradients. We find
              that when spatial pattern is accounted for in the modeling
              process, conclusions about environmental control over abundance
              can change dramatically. We conclude with five lessons: 1) spatial
              models are easy to calculate with several of the most common
              statistical packages; 2) results from spatially-structured models
              may point to conclusions radically different from those suggested
              by a spatially independent model; 3) not all spatial
              autocorrelation in abundances results from spatial population
              dynamics; it may also result from abundance associations with
              environmental variables not included in the model; 4) the
              different spatial models do have different mechanistic
              interpretations in terms of ecological processes - thus ecological
              model selection should take primacy over statistical model
              selection; 5) the conclusions of the different spatial models are
              typically fairly similar - making any correction is more important
              than quibbling about which correction to make",

              context of the color of environmental noise and extinction risk of
              populations. We use a stochastic model to simulate population
              dynamics with compensatory density regulation under four different
              patterns of periodically fluctuating environments. We found that
              extinction risk changes dramatically from what was known if the
              underlying en ironmental stochasticity driving population dynamics
              is periodically correlated rather than randomly correlated.
              Fluctuating environments with a very short period are found to
              decrease extinction risk over ``white noise'' fluctuations because
              a species is never in a bad environment for too long. Conversely.
              long periods increase extinction risk because species accumulate
              too much time in a bad environment. Moreover, we found the mean,
              variance, frequency distribution and especially the extensively
              studied noise color not to be sufficient for predicting extinction
              risk in periodically fluctuating environments. Rather, additional
              attributes of environmental noise have to be considered. The
              occurrence of monotonic trends within time series of environmental
              data (e.g. after 'disturbance' events), in combination with
              density regulation, may also affect extinction risk. Our study
              exemplifies that the investigation of periodically fluctuating

              genotypes. With these assumptions, some very re- markable theorems
              have been proved, in which fitness plays a major role. Fisher1 was
              able to show that, unless the degree of inbreeding varies or the
              environment deteriorates, the mean fitness aiways increases; and
              he gave a formula for the rate of increase. Haldane2 showed that,

              the number of genetic deaths (actually f (r,,, - r)dt, where r,,,

              host-parasite model in which the interactions are determined by
              quantitative characters. Both models are extensions of
              one-dimensional difference equations that can exhibit complicated
              dynamics. Compared to these basic models, the phenotypic
              variability given by the quantitative characters reduces the size
              of the density fluctuations in asexual populations. With sexual
              reproduction, which is described by modeling the genetics of the
              quantitative character explicitly with many haploid loci that
              determine the character additively, this reduction in fitness
              variance is magnified. Moreover, quantitative genetics can induce
              simple dynamics. For example, the sexual population can have a
              two-cycle when the asexual system is chaotic. This paper discusses
              the consequences for the evolution of sex. The higher mean growth
              rate implied by the lower fitness variance in sexual populations
              is n advantage that can overcome a twofold intrinsic growth rate
              of asexuals. The advantage is bigger when the asexual population
              contains only a subset of the phenotypes present in the sexual
              population, which conforms with the tangled bank theory for the
              evolution of sex and shows that tangled bank effects also occur in
              host-parasite systems. The results suggest that explicitly
              describing the genetics of a quantitative character leads to more
              flexible models than the usual assumption of normal character
              distributions, and therefore to a better understanding of the

               undergo severe population bottlenecks at each host generation,
               resulting in a reduction in effective population size (Ne).
               Previous studies of Buchnera, the primary endosymbiont of aphids,
               and of several other species of endosymbiotic bacteria have shown
               that these species exhibit an increase in the rate of
               substitution of slightly deleterious mutations, among other
               predicted effects of increased drift due to small Ne, such as
               reduced codon bias. However, these studies have been limited in
               taxonomic scope, and it was therefore not clear whether the
               increase in rate is a general feature of endosymbiont lineages.
               Here, we test the prediction that a long-term reduction in Ne
               causes an increase in substitution rate using DNA sequences of
               the 16S rRNA gene from 13 phylogenetically independent
               comparisons between taxonomically diverse endosymbiotic
               microorganisms and their free-living relatives. Maximum
               likelihood and distance-based methods both indicate a significant
               increase in substitution rate in a wide range of bacterial and
               fungal endosymbionts compared to closely related free-living
               lineages. We use the same data set to test whether 16S genes from
               endosymbionts display increased A + T content, another indicator
               of increased genetic drift, and find that there is no significant
               difference in base composition between endosymbiont and
               nonendosymbiont 16S genes. However, analysis of an additional
               data set of whole bacterial genomes demonstrates that, while
               host-dependent bacteria have significantly increased genomic A +
               T content, the base content of the 16S gene tends to vary less
               than that of the whole genome. It is possible that selection for
               stability of rRNA is strong enough to overcome the effects of
               drift toward increased A + T content in endosymbiont 16S genes,

              genetics span from understanding the mechanistic bases of the
              evolution of organisms in a community context to identifying the
              role of genetic variation in generating community patterns. Is
              community genetics an emerging subdiscipline that finally unites
              multispecies ecology with the genetics of evolutionary change? It
              is argued that a mature understanding of either ecological
              communities or the evolution of species will require community
              genetics. Others cry that this label is nothing more than
              funding-agency-style renaming of perfectly good, classic questions
              in evolutionary ecology. I have asked two of the leading groups in
              community genetics to lay down the definitions and set the agenda
              for future work: Neuhauser et al., who established a Center for
              Community Genetics at the University of Minnesota; and Whitham et
              al., who have been studying the consequences of genetic variation
              for diverse communities and community processes. The result is two
              fresh and controversial lead papers. Following these papers are
              commentaries from eight respondents. Some of these authors were
              pioneers in bridging the fields of community ecology and
              evolution; others are newcomers seeking to infuse ecology with
              novelty. The result is a mix of arguments that illustrate the

              paradigm which deals with the effect of smallness on the
              persistence of a population, and the declining-population paradigm
              which deals with the cause of smallness and its cure. 2. The
              processes relevant to the small-population paradigm are amenable
              to theoretical examination because they generalize across species
              and are subsumed by an inclusive higher category: stochasticity.
              3. In contrast, the processes relevant to the declining-population
              paradigm are essentially humdrum, being not one but many. So far
              they have defied tight generalization and hence are of scant
              theoretical interest. 4. The small-population paradigm has not yet
              contributed significantly to conserving endangered species in the
              wild because it treats an effect (smallness) as if it were a
              cause. It provides an answer only to a trivial question: how long
              will the population persist if nothing unusual happens? Rather,
              its major contribution has been to captive breeding and to the
              design of reserve systems. 5. The declining-population paradigm,
              on the other hand, is that relevant to most problems of
              conservation. It summons an investigation to discover the cause of
              the decline and to prescribe its antidote. Hence, at least at our
              current level of understanding, it evokes only an ecological
              investigation which, although utilizing the rigour of tight
              hypotheses and careful experimentation, is essentially a one-off
              study of little theoretical interest. 6. The principal
              contribution of the small-population paradigm is the theoretical
              underpinning that it imparted to conservation biology, even though
              most of that theory presently bears tenuous relevance to the
              specific problems of aiding a species in trouble. It would
              contribute immeasurably more if some of the theoretical momentum
              so generated were channelled into providing a theory of driven
              population declines, thereby liberating the declining-population
              paradigm from the inefficiency of case-by-case ecological
              investigations and recovery operations. 7. The declinin
              -population paradigm is urgently in need of more theory. The
              small-population paradigm needs more practice. Each has much to
              learn from the other. A cautious intermixing of the two might well
              lead to a reduction in the rate at which species are presently
              going extinct",

              of approaches for studying chaos in ecology: models, analysis of
              time series, and experiments. Current ideas from modelling
              approaches demonstrate the plausibility of chaos. New approaches

              coincident mosaic results from simultaneous demographic processes
              shaped by extrinsic forces over Pleistocene climate fluctuations.
              However, DNA sequence variation at two rapidly evolving unlinked
              nuclear loci, Mannose phosphate isomerase (Mpi) and Triose
              phosphate isomerase (Tpi), show that the comimetic species have

              ongoing lineage sorting across the Andes, nuclear genealogical
              estimates showed little geographical structure, suggesting high
              historical gene flow. Coalescent-based demographic analysis

              of Pleistocene population fragmentation facilitating allopatric

              diversity, theta, in H. melpomene was reduced relative to its

              demographic histories suggest that the wing-pattern radiations

              population size (N(e)) in H. erato, together with profound

              environments in Daphnia pulex (Cladocera: Crustacea): (1) effects
              of temporal variation on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity;
              (2) plasticity in sexual versus asexual lineages; (3) maintenance
              of genetic variation in variable environments. We performed a
              72 quasi-natural selection experiment comparing three patterns
              of variation: constant temperatures, varying but predictable
              temperature change, and unpredictable temperature change. All
              populations were begun with an identical array of 34 clones.
              During selection clonal variation declined in all populations and
              different patterns of environmental variation had little effect on
              amounts of genetic variation. Sexual and asexual lineages differed
              in size and growth rate, but did not differ in amounts of
              plasticity or in adaptation to variable environments. The primary
              target of selection was the Malthusian parameter (r) and life
              history traits of development time, offspring size and offspring
              number. The heritability of plasticity was generally lower than
              trait heritability. Because of this difference, the selection
              response on the mean of the traits overwhelmed the selection
              response on plasticity. Lower heritabilities of plasticity are
              very typical, suggesting that our results will be typical of
              responses to selection in nature. Our results suggest that
              selection will act mostly on trait means within environments and
              that plasticity will evolve often as a correlated trait. Because
              selection on plasticity is based on its across-deme, global
              fitness, this process will usually be slow. Comparative studies

              individuals is influenced by a quantitative character whose value
              is determined additively by alleles from many loci. With
              assortative mating based on this character, frequency- and
              density-dependent competition can subdivide a population with an
              initially unimodal character distribution. The character
              distribution becomes bimodal, and the subpopulations corresponding
              to the two modes are reproductively separated because mating is
              assortative. This happens if the resource distribution is
              unimodal, i.e. even if selection due to phenotypic carrying
              capacities is not disruptive. The results suggest that sympatric
              speciation due to frequency-dependent selection can occur in quite
              general ecological scenarios if mating is assortative. I also
              discuss the evolution of assortative mating. Since it induces
              bimodal phenotype distributions, assortative mating leads to a
              better match of the resources if their distribution is also
              bimodal. Moreover, in a population with a bimodal phenotype
              distribution, the average strength of frequency-dependent
              competition is lower than in a unimodal population. Therefore,
              assortative mating permits higher equilibrium densities than
              random mating even if the resource distribution is unimodal. Thus,
              even though it may lead to a less efficient resource use,
              assortative mating is favoured over random mating because it
              reduces frequency-dependent effects of competition",

               mainland demonstrate a biogeographic pattern of morphological
               variation suggestive of character displacement. Two species of

              of the evolving populations relative to their common ancestor
              improved greatly, but their fitnesses relative to one another
              diverged only slightly. Although the populations showed similar
              fitness increases, they may have done so by different underlying
              adaptations, or they may have diverged in other respects by random
              genetic drift. Therefore, we examined the relative fitnesses of
              independently derived genotypes in two other sugars, maltose and
              lactose, to determine whether they were homogeneous or
              heterogeneous in these environments. The genetic variation among
              the derived lines in fitness on maltose and lactose was more than
              100 greater than their variation in fitness on glucose.
              Moreover, the glucose-adapted genotypes, on average, showed
              significant adaptation to lactose, but not to maltose. That
              pathways for use of maltose and glucose are virtually identical in
              E. coli, except for their distinct mechanisms of uptake, suggests
              that the derived genotypes have adapted primarily by improved
              glucose transport. From consideration of the number of generations
              of divergence, the mutation rate in E. coli, and the proportion of
              its genome required for growth on maltose (but not glucose), we
              hypothesize that pleiotropy involving the selected alleles, rather
              than random genetic drift of alleles at other loci, was the major
              cause of the variation among the derived genotypes in fitness on
              these other sugars",

              affects predator-prey (rotifer-algal) cycles in laboratory
              microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a
              model for our system that allows prey evolution(9). We verified
              the predicted existence of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal
              competitive ability and defence against consumption, and examined
              its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary
              potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures
              (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and
              typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator

              cultures produced long cycles with prey and predator densities
              nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted. These results confirm
              that prey evolution can substantially alter predator-prey
              dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand population

              important role in determining long-term evolutionary trends.
              Several independent lines of research have arisen from considering
              differ- ent kinds of variation. Dempster (1955) introduced a model
              in which temporal fluctuations in reproductive success for
              competing genotypes favor the genotype with the highest
              geometric-mean reproductive success. Levene (1953) studied a case
              in which the relative success of alleles varies spatially within a
              generation. These two papers established the dichotomy between
              temporal and spatial varia- tion that most authors continue to
              use. Gillespie (1974a) considered still another kind of variation,
              variation in the reproductive success of each individual, in which
              the amount of variation depends on factors such as developmental
              homeo- stasis. Gillespie's (1974a) model has led to extensive
              discussion of the idea of evolutionary ``bet hedging'' (Slatkin

              incorporate population genetics. In Slatkin's pioneering model
              (Slatkin 1980), the genetics of the quantitative character
              determining the competitive interactions are modeled by assuming
              that the character is normally distributed in each generation.
              Only the mean and the variance of the character distributions
              change over time. With symmetric ecological assumptions for the
              two competing species, and with normally distributed resources
              that are equally used by both species, this model did not yield
              significant displacement. This has led to the belief that
              ecological asymmetries or constraints on resource use, e.g., by
              constraining the phenotypic variances, are necessary for character
              displacement. I argue that the reason for the negative result in
              Slatkin's original model is that the genetics are modeled too
              rigidly. With a more flexible genetic model, obtained by
              explicitly modeling many loci with additive effects, character
              displacement occurs as a rule even for symmetric ecological
              assumptions and without constraints on the phenotype
              distributions. The model can also be used in other contexts than
              competition for resources. For example, character displacement in
              a host-parasite system can lead to parasite specialization. The
              results suggest that more detailed genetic models yield a finer
              resolution of the interaction between population genetics and
              ecological dynamics. Explicit genetics lead to more insights than
              the usual quantitative genetic assumption of normal character

              reproduction because, under the turbulent chemostat regime, males
              were unable to mate with females, produced no offspring, and so
              had zero fitness. In replicated chemostat experiments we found
              that this evolutionary process directly influenced the population
              dynamics. We observed very specific but reproducible plankton
              dynamics which are explained well by a mathematical model that
              explicitly includes evolution. This model accounts for both
              asexual and sexual reproduction and treats the propensity to
              reproduce sexually as a quantitative trait under selection. We
              suggest that a similar amalgam of ecological and evolutionary
              mechanisms may drive the dynamics of rapidly reproducing organisms
              in the wild.",

              sensitivity parameter that does not affect the dynamic complexity
              of these models. We show that genetic variability in this
              parameter can have a strong effect on population dynamics. We
              incorporate ecological dynamics in two different population
              genetic models with one locus and two alleles. The first is the
              classical model of a randomly mating population in Hardy-Weinberg
              equilibrium, and the second is a model of differential selection
              in males and females. In populations in Hardy-Weinberg
              equilibrium, variability in the sensitivity parameter can be
              maintained by overdominance. In this case, the dynamics of the
              polymorphic population tend to be much simpler than those of
              monomorphic populations. In the model with different selection in
              males and females, polymorphisms can be maintained in various
              ways, e.g., by opposing directional selection in males and
              females. Polymorphism in the sensitivity parameter tends to
              simplify population dynamics in the model with different selection
              in males and females as well. A number of interesting dynamic
              effects can be observed, e.g., multiple attractors with
              complicated basins of attraction. Then the final state of the
              system after a successful invasion by mutant alleles may depend on
              the mutation rate and on the distribution of mutational steps. In
              addition, there are situations in which genetic variability
              destabilizes a stable population dynamic equilibrium in the
              monomorphic model. There is an analogy between genetic variability
              and variability imposed by the environment. If differences in
              sensitivity are caused by the environment, dynamic effects similar
              to those in the genetic models can be observed. In addition,
              source-sink structures that are known to occur in spatially
              structured models can be seen in the genetic model if one of the
              genotypes is inviable. The results suggest that combining
              ecological and population genetic models can lead to a number of
              new insights. More work is needed, e.g., with fertility models, in

              immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should be initiated with a
              four-drug or two sequential three-drug regimens. METHODS: In this
              multicenter trial we compared initial therapy involving four-drug
              regimens containing efavirenz and nelfinavir in combination with
              either didanosine and stavudine or zidovudine and lamivudine with
              therapy involving two consecutive three-drug regimens the first of
              which contained either efavirenz or nelfinavir. RESULTS: A total
              of 980 subjects were followed for a median of 2.3 years. There was
              no significant difference in the occurrence of regimen failures
              between the group that received the four-drug regimen containing
              didanosine, stavudine, nelfinavir, and efavirenz and the groups
              that received the three-drug regimens beginning with didanosine,
              stavudine, and nelfinavir (hazard ratio for regimen failure, 1.24)
              or didanosine, stavudine, and efavirenz (hazard ratio, 1.01).
              There was no significant difference between the group that
              received the four-drug regimen containing zidovudine, lamivudine,
              nelfinavir, and efavirenz and the groups that received the
              three-drug regimens beginning with zidovudine, lamivudine, and

              efavirenz (hazard ratio, 1.45). A four-drug regimen was associated
              with a longer time to the first regimen failure than the
              three-drug regimens containing didanosine, stavudine, and
              nelfinavir (hazard ratio for a first regimen failure, 0.55);
              didanosine, stavudine, and efavirenz (hazard ratio, 0.63); or

              not the three-drug regimen containing zidovudine, lamivudine, and

              significant difference in the duration of successful HIV-1
              treatment between a single four-drug regimen and two consecutive
              three-drug regimens. Among these treatment strategies, initiating
              therapy with the three-drug regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine, and

              community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process:
              selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents
              deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents
              stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new
              species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space.
              All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be

              Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of

              communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative

              This result has been derived previously using genetic models with
              very special assumptions about the population age structure. Here
              we explore its robustness in more realistic population models,
              with very general age structure or physiological structure. For a
              range of genetic models (haploid, diploid, single and multilocus)
              we find that the condition for maintaining genetic diversity
              generalizes almost without change. Genetic diversity is maintained
              by selection if a product of the form (generation overlap) x
              (selection intensity) x (variability in the selection regime) is
              sufficiently large, where the generation overlap is measured in
              units of Fisher's reproductive value. This conclusion is based on
              a local evolutionary stability analysis, which differs from the
              standard ''protected polymorphism'' criterion for the maintenance
              of genetic diversity. Simulation results match the predictions
              from the local stability analysis, but not those from the
              protected polymorphism criterion. The condition obtained here for
              maintaining genetic diversity requires fitness fluctuations that
              are substantial but well within the range observed in many studies

              than for the best single species, even though high phenotypic
              variance decreases productivity in the short term, because
              suboptimal species are present. In addition, we find that in the
              case of accelerating environmental change, species succession in a
              changing environment may become discontinuous. Our work suggests
              that this phenomenon is related to diversity as well as to the
              environmental disturbance regime, both of which are affected by
              anthropogenic activities. By introducing new techniques for
              modeling the aggregate behavior of groups of species, the present
              approach may provide a new avenue for ecosystem analysis.",

              Tasmania, Australia, which had had a relatively high level of
              production over many years was investigated. Benthic samples were
              collected along transects which ran across the farms, generally
              from 100 m upstream to 100 m downstream. Sediment deposition,
              redox values, sediment sulphide concentrations, organic carbon
              content and water turbidity levels near the bottom were
              significantly different between the farms but not between sites
              outside the farm, at the boundary and sites within the farm. Video
              recordings at one farm showed dense coverage of fine filamentous
              algae and patchy bacterial mats directly under some longlines and
              this algae is thought to have fallen off the mussel longlines. At
              another farm dense beds of seagrass were observed in the videos
              both under trays of oysters and outside the farm. The benthic
              infauna did not show clear signs of organic enrichment, and
              neither univariate nor multivariate measures of benthic infauna
              were significantly different between sites inside and outside the
              farm, although they were different between farms. It was concluded
              from these results that shellfish fanning is having little impact,
              and much less than salmon fanning, on the benthic environment in
              Tasmania. Thus extensive monitoring of shellfish farms would
              appear to be not necessary. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

              to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or destabilize
              interactions; stability is most likely when only the predator
              evolves, or when traits in one or both species are under strong
              stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely when there is
              coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey vulnerability. When
              population cycles exist, adaptation may either increase or
              decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An increase in the
              defensive ability of prey is less likely to produce evolutionary
              counter- measures in its partner than is a comparable increase in
              attack ability of the predator. Increased productivity may
              increase or decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The
              apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of prey to
              predators over those of predators to prey is in general accord
              with equilibrium theory, but theory on sta- bility may be
              difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on geographically
              structured populations promises to advance our understanding of

               study of adaptive radiations highlights a gap in our knowledge
               about determining whether a clade constitutes adaptive
               diversification. Specifically, no objective criteria exist to
               judge whether a clade constitutes an adaptive radiation. Most
               clades, given enough time, will diversify adaptively to some
               extent; therefore, we argue that the term ``adaptive radiation''
               should be reserved for those clades that are exceptionally
               diverse in terms of the range of habitats occupied and attendant
               morphological adaptations. Making such a definition operational,
               however, requires a comparative analysis of many clades. Only by
               comparing clades can one distinguish those that are exceptionally
               diverse (or nondiverse) from those exhibiting a normal degree of
               adaptive disparity. We propose such a test, focusing on disparity
               in the ecological morphology of monophyletic groups within the
               lizard family Iguanidae. We find that two clades, the
               Polychrotinae and Phrynosomatinae, are exceptionally diverse and
               that two others, the Crotaphytinae and Oplurinae, are
               exceptionally nondiverse. Potential explanations for differences
               in diversity are discussed, as are caveats and future extensions

              points out that there are several very general law-like
              propositions that provide the theoretical basis for most
              population dynamics models that were developed to address specific
              issues. Some of these foundational principles, like the law of
              exponential growth, are logically very similar to certain law of
              physics (Newton's law of intertia, for example, is almost a direct
              analogue of exponential growth). The author discusses two other
              principles (population self-limitation and resource-consumer
              oscillations), as well as the more elementary postulates that
              underlie them. None of the ``laws'' that the author proposes for
              population ecology are new. Collectively ecologists have been
              using these general principles in guiding development of their
